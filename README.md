Car Service Management System
This is my final project for my Professional Bachelor's degree at SMK. I built it to help car services handle their daily tasks more easily.

Tech I used:

Frontend: React.js 

Backend: Flask (Python) 

Database: MySQL 

What it does:

Manages customer info and service history.

Connects the React frontend with a Flask API.

Handles data using a MySQL database
